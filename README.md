# MangaFinder

# A website application that recommends manga to users based off their preferences using machine learning.

The idea of Manga Finder is to create a website where you can log in and find manga recommendations based off your previous reads. This will be done with an ML built on PyTorch. We are planning to use Flask for the backend framework, MongoDB for our database, PyMongo to connect Flask and MongoDB, Bcrypt for password hashing, CORS for handling different protocols, PyTorch for the ML algorithm, Jikan API for manga data, JWT for user authentication, Axios for handling API requests, and React for the UI, Dotenv for enviroment managament, PyTest for testing, Redux for frontend mangament, Flas-Limiter for rate limiting, and Marshmallow for data validation.

Some features we are planning to have are a content-based filtering ML algorithm that finds you new manga to read. User account system where users can have a currently reading list, a want to read list, and an already read list, they can also like or dislike a title. Users could also see what their friends are currently reading, want to read, and already read. Provide links for users to read manga on different websites. Track user data to see which titles are most popular on the website. Notification system that notifies users when a manga they like gets a new chapter, or notify them when we find a manga that is popular that they might enjoy.
